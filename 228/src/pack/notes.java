/*Interfaces are a _contract_
 * When you implement an interface, you promise to provide implementations for its methods.
 * 
 * Annotations:
 * Not strictly necessary, more of a hint to the compiler
 * Dynamic vs static types:
 * Static types can be thought of as the compile time type. 
 * The dynamic type can be thought of as the runtime type.
 * 
 * Dynamic Binding:
 * It will look up the method implementation on the subtype that implements it.
 * 
 * Casts:
 * (typename) var - you are telling the compiler that var is the type typename, despite what the compiler may already think.
 * 
 * Classes can only extend _one_ other class.
 * 
 * if you cast a type
